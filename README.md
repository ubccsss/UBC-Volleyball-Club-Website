# UBC Volleyball Club Website

### What will you be building, and how will it be used?
We aim to build out a web based application in partnership with the UBC Volleyball club to help provide seamless scheduling, efficient communication, and enhanced data tracking for practices and games. Through the new platform, athletes will be able to sign up for shifts, view schedules, and receive availability notifications through email. Coaches and team members will have access to practice plans and game statistics, enabling better performance analysis and player development. The app will also facilitate communication among team members, coaches, and club executives, fostering a more connected and supportive volleyball community. 

### Why is it important?
The importance of this tech project extends beyond just improving the volleyball experience for athletes at UBC. By offering a centralized and user-friendly platform, the UBC Volleyball Club can elevate the overall experience for its members, providing them with a more intense and fulfilling volleyball environment. The applicationâ€™s features will streamline club operations, enhance team coordination, and create a space for athletes to excel, both individually and as part of a team.
